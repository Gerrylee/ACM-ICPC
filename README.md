# ACM-ICPC

> Were it to benefit my rank I would stay from my bed; What then is risk to me?

Here lies most of the codes I've written along the path of pursuing my dream about ACM-ICPC.

Those `Accepted` they've brought has driven me to move forward restlessly.

At day, I'm with the ones I love. But as night falls, code and algorithms are my only companion.  

Along the path, I've encountered countless failures. I cried over broken glasses with broken heart. I realized it had always seemed impossible, yet the desire burning in my heart has never been stronger.

I had been made to believe that I'm not good at mathematical thinking. Even today, I still admit it as a fact. But even though I am not built for it, even though all my hard work will finally lead to catastrophe, there should be nothing in my way of pursuing what I am passionate about.

It has always been a losing battle. It has been a tragedy from the very beginning. I know it. **I just simply love the scenery along the path.**
